# Enclosure

The STL file here will allow you to print a case for the adapter. This was designed primarily with a resin printer in mind, but can be printed with a standard 3D printer with some minor experimentation to get the right fit. The single screw used for this is a standard #4-40 round-head machine screw with a 1/2 inch length (M3x0.5, if using metric hardware).
